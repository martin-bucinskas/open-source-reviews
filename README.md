# Open Source Reviews

A GitHub action that requests a review for a pull request from users 
that are part of the open source review community.

## Why

Getting started writing good quality open source code can be difficult
at times. Especially finding a group to review the pull requests when
working on your own.

This is where the idea of open source reviews came in.
The action brings the open source community together.
